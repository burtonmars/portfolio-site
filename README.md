# Portfolio Site

My portfolio site is a frontend app I built with React to showcase my most recent projects. I am still not completely happy with the UI, so it should be ever-evolving. The biggest challenge I faced building this web app was getting my custom contact form functional. I achieved this in the end using [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/), which gave me all the functionality I needed on a free plan.
