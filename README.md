# Portfolio Site

My portfolio site is a frontend app I built with React to showcase my most recent projects. I am still not completely happy with the UI, so it should be ever-evolving. The app can be viewed on all device sizes, but for a complete look at the UI it should be viewed on a desktop. 

The biggest challenge I faced building this web app was getting my custom contact form functional. I had templated contact forms before, but this was the first one I built that actually needed to work. I achieved this in the end using [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/), which allows me to send emails directly from my client-side javascript.

The site should be live, but can also be cloned and run locally using:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
```
